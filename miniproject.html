        📌📌Dry fruits are high in nutrients and have a variety of medicinal
        properties. They are considered delicacies, but due to their health
        benefits, they have become a must-buy. Even children who tend to avoid
        fresh fruits are enamored with them. If you enjoy yogurt, smoothies,
        oatmeal, or other healthy breakfast options, you can add dry fruits to
        any of these and give it a tastier and healthier spin. Since dry fruits
        are smaller in size, you can take them with you anywhere and eat them
        anywhere to get a boost of energy and to satisfy your hunger. Moreover,
        they are free of added sugars, cholesterol, and sodium, which is an
        exciting benefit. <br />
        <br /><br />
        Dry fruits are small, but they are high in minerals and proteins. Every
        healthcare professional recommends including a handful of dry fruits in
        our diet to keep us healthy and fit. Dry fruits come in a plethora of
        varieties, including raisins, cashew nuts, almonds, pistachios, walnuts,
        dates, plums, and so on. Dry fruits are said to have a slew of health
        benefits if consumed in moderation. We’ve compiled a list of dry fruits
        that add nutritional value to your everyday food and provide you with
        multiple health benefits.
